**2024 Global Artificial Intelligence Innovation Competition & Hong Kong-Macao University Student Maker Marathon**

---

### **1. Project Introduction**  
With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence has become a key driver of societal progress and industrial innovation. In response to the call for "mass entrepreneurship and innovation," to thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and to align with the development needs of the AI industry, Fudan University, in collaboration with the Administrative Committee, is organizing the **2024 Global Artificial Intelligence Innovation Competition & Hong Kong-Macao University Student Maker Marathon**.  

To further strengthen technological innovation cooperation between mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to advance the digital-intelligent transformation of the global AI industry, the 2024 competition will continue to identify and select innovative and entrepreneurial talents from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and global youth. By nurturing their innovation, creativity, technical capabilities, and entrepreneurial spirit, the event aims to help participants realize their entrepreneurial dreams and contribute youthful energy to the AI industry.  

The 2024 edition will place greater emphasis on collaborative innovation with governments, enterprises, and universities to jointly build industrial ecosystems and drive business model transformations. Through enhanced support for technological development and talent cultivation, the competition will provide broader innovation platforms and richer resources for mainland and Hong Kong-Macao youth, injecting new vitality into cross-regional collaboration and the global AI industry.

**Enterprise Name**  
Shanghai Jiacheng Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.  

**Company Introduction**  
We are a technology company with independent design and R&D capabilities. Our technical team has previously worked for renowned IT enterprises such as Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft. Over the years, we have completed multiple provincial/municipal-level projects and initiatives under the "Belt and Road" framework, spanning fields like **general AI, big data visualization, metaverse virtual reality, and digital twin cities**.  

We contributed to the development of the **"Shanghai Metro" digital management platform**, supporting the construction of Shanghai’s smart city.  

**Selected Track**  
Smart City "Public Service System"  

**Challenge Background**  
Centered on the "Smart City" development of the Lingang New Area, this track leverages IoT, cloud computing, big data, AI, and smart devices to improve urban transportation, energy, environment, and public services. The goal is to enable city administrators to better monitor and manage resources, enhance public service efficiency, reduce governance costs, meet residents’ needs, and elevate quality of life. By delivering efficient and convenient public services, the project aims to attract talent and investment, driving economic growth in the New Area.  

**Challenge Overview**  
Use IT and smart devices to provide efficient, convenient, and high-quality public services that meet urban residents’ needs, improve quality of life, and ensure comprehensive public safety management. Examples include:  
- Monitoring public facilities (fire hydrants, manholes, utility poles, billboards, etc.)  
- Crowd gathering alerts  
- High-risk individual tracking  
- Trajectory analysis  
- Urban便民 service development  

**Technical Objectives**  
Design a top-level framework for urban public service systems with the following features:  
1. Architecture supporting **1,000+ monitoring points** and **100 concurrent requests**.  
2. High configurability of data metrics.  
3. Multi-device compatibility (Pad, PC) for scenario demonstration and control interfaces.  
4. Configurable data sources (API, Excel, JSON, relational databases) with standardized access protocols.  
5. Clear, logical, and unified scenario animations with sci-tech aesthetics.  
6. All metric rendering completed within **1 second**.  

**Input Requirements**  
- Metric data (via API, Excel, JSON, or databases)  
- Surveillance video feeds  

**Output Expectations**  
Visualized scenarios highlighting key management priorities for public service systems.  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
1. **Scenario Logic**: Cohesive主线 design with data-driven transitions between scenarios.  
2. **Design Quality**: Unified 2D/3D visualization and user-friendly interfaces.  
3. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable code with no runtime errors.  
4. **Rendering Speed**:  
   - A+: <1 second  
   - A: 1–1.5 seconds  
   - B: 1.5–2 seconds  
   - Fail: >2 seconds  
5. **Metric Editability**: Support for **8+ data visualization types** (bar charts, line graphs, dashboards, pie charts, heatmaps, monitoring panels, progress bars, gauges).  
6. **Data Source Diversity**: Support for **4+ data sources** (Excel, MySQL/SQL Server, API, JSON).  

**Ranking Formula**  
Weighted scores based on:  
Scenario logic, rendering speed, code quality, metric configurability, data source diversity, and design quality.
