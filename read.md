Here is a list of important concepts your team should be familiar with to understand the requirements you have outlined:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation (mandatory)**:
   - Understanding of data formats such as CSV and MP4 for training models.
   - Data sourcing and preprocessing techniques.

2. **Containerization and Orchestration (optinal)**:
   - Docker basics for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers.
   - Kubernetes for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment.

3. **Machine Learning Models (mandatory)**:
   - Car detection models and their training processes.
   - Predictive modeling using real-time and historical data for parking demand.

4. **API Development (mandatory)**:
   - Creating APIs to interact with machine learning models for inference.
   - REST and WebSocket protocols for communication.

5. **Microservices Architecture / Message Queues**:
   - Designing and developing microservices for specific functionalities.
   - Communication between microservices in a distributed system.
   - Kafka for building real-time data pipelines.
   - Kafka consumers for processing and storing data in databases.

6. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Tools like Apache Airflow or Kestra for orchestrating workflows and managing dependencies between tasks.

7. **Database Management (optional)**:
   - Understanding datetime databases and how to store and query time-series data efficiently.

9. **Deployment and Scaling (optional)**:
   - Deploying microservices in Kubernetes clusters.
   - Monitoring and scaling applications in a containerized environment.

This list covers a broad range of topics that are essential for implementing the system you have outlined. Your team members should have a good grasp of these concepts to effectively work on the project.
